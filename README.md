The--Ultimate-Pencil-Holder-
============================
Readme:

-	To expand on the pencil holder design
-	Objective: To be able to make the body and the top detachable (variations between materials and roles for the top/body)
-	Goals: To make the whole object as small as possible and still be able to hold 7 pens/pencils. To understand how it will physically attach to each other without falling apart and still be sturdy enough to hold. To expand on my theory of “the form itself is more important than the materials when it comes to its performance”
